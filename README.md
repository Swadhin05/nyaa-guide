# Lesson 1

- Look at the column with green numbers. 
- Without going deeper, the higher the green number, the faster the file will download. 
- Generally, most mini-encodes and good high-bitrate releases have higher numbers. 
- We call the green numbers **seeder** and the red numbers **leecher**.

# Lesson 2

- You will most likely encounter three keywords: `AV1`, `HEVC`, and `AVC`. 
- `AVC` files are mostly high-bitrate releases directly ripped from **Crunchyroll**, **Netflix** etc., without modification, exactly as provided by the streaming site.
- `HEVC`, and`AV1` are mini-encodes. They are smaller versions of those files, usually good for storage and low internet speeds. Video quality in a good mini-encode is often identical to the original large file.
- You should usually priorities `HEVC` over `AV1` because it is easier to play on most mobile phones and weaker hardware, though `AV1` tends to have a smaller size.
- So, we'll choose the second one here.
